# Daily Problem Practice

This repository contains solutions to coding problems that I practice on a regular basis.  
Each problem is organized into a separate folder with the following contents:

- **README.md** – contains the problem description.  
- **Solution file(s)** – contains the implementation in the chosen programming language.  
- **Additional files** – if required for testing or setup.  

The goal of this repository is to maintain consistency in problem solving, track progress over time, and build a collection of solutions that can be referenced later.  

## Structure

## How to Use
- Navigate to the problem folder to read the problem statement.  
- Open the solution file to see the implementation.  
- Code is written with clarity and simplicity for better understanding.  

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal practice log and can also be useful for interview preparation.
